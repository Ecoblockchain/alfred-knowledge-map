#Description
- Search through my [Mind Maps](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/research) with Alfred
	- Just start the search and open the mind map that you were looking for fast, wherever you are
	- I try to keep them constantly updated
	- get familiar with the [index](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/research#mindmap-index-%EF%B8%8F) so you are not searching in the dark

If you are interested in indexing my mind maps in this way but are not using macOS or Alfred. I am very interested in extending this implementation to other launchers like [Cerebro](https://cerebroapp.com/) or [Mutate](https://github.com/qdore/Mutate) or some other launcher. 

Essentially you have to parse [this markdown file](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/alfred-my-mindmaps/blob/master/research.md) with links to mind maps in a format that your launcher supports. If you do have the time or interest for it, I am open to any kind of pull request to add support to more launchers.


- Big thank you to [Vitor](https://github.com/vitorgalvao) for its implementation
