#Description
- Search through my [Mind Maps](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/research) with Alfred
	- Just start the search and open the mind map that you were looking for fast, wherever you are
	- I try to keep them constantly updated
	- get familiar with the [index](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/research#mindmap-index-%EF%B8%8F) so you are not searching in the dark
