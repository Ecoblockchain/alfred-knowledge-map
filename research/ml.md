# [artificial intelligence ✨](https://my.mindnode.com/Zf9GpxWxJQsySjHW1ygC5DDP3aE5PowqnpegAike#-250.1,-457.5,0)

- is intelligence exhibited by machines  
- it is the study of ‘intelligent agents’ (any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximise its chance of success at some goal)  
- the term applies what a machine mimics ‘cognitive’ functions that humans associate with other human minds, such as ‘learning’ and ‘problem solving’  
- as machines become increasingly capable, mental facilities once thought to require intelligence are removed from the definition  
- central problems (or goals) of AI research include reasoning, knowledge, planning, learning, natural language processing (communication), perception and the ability to move and manipulate objects  
- approaches include  
	- statistical methods  
	- computational intelligence  
	- traditional symbolic AI  
- the field was founded on the claim that ‘human intelligence can be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it’  
  
  
  
- ability of a computer program or a machine to think and learn, making computers ‘smart’


## [deep learning ✨](https://my.mindnode.com/ycU59gAXTjsXkJqjR2xAYawvcFuXqUPbxiDpBX4z)

- is a class of machine learning algorithms that :   
	- use a cascade of many layers of nonlinear processing units for feature extraction and transformation  
		- each successive layer uses the output from the previous layer as input  
		- the algorithms may be supervised or unsupervised and applications include pattern analysis (unsupervised) and classification (supervised)  
	- are based on the (unsupervised) learning of multiple levels of features or representations of the data  
		- higher level features are derived from lower level features to form a hierarchical representation  
	- are part of the broader machine learning field of learning representations of data  
	- learn multiple levels of representations that correspond to different levels of abstraction (the levels form a hierarchy of concepts)

## [general intelligence ✨](https://my.mindnode.com/zUq3psGBcMb3i5VoqxtqKL4KtNu5VyLqQYWGxW98#439.6,-352.1,0)

- is the intelligence of a machine that could successfully perform any intellectual task that a human being can  
- it is required to do the following  
	- reason, use strategy, solve puzzles, and make judgements under uncertainty  
	- represent knowledge, including common sense knowledge  
	- plan  
	- learn  
	- communicate in natural language  
	- and integrate all these skills towards common goals  
- other important capabilities include the ability to sense (e.g. see) and the ability to act (e.g. move and manipulate objects) in the world where intelligent behaviour is to be observed 


# [machine learning ✨](https://my.mindnode.com/zB6jcZpgGYqpGBfys7LXzBaej8qgUBwAo7kJssze#645.0,-1695.8,0)

- gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed  
- evolved from the study of pattern recognition and computational learning theory in ai  
- it explores the study and construction of algorithms that can learn from and make predictions on data  
	- such algorithms overcome following strictly static program instructions by making data driven predictions or decisions, through building a model from sample inputs  
- ‘a computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E’


## [reinforcement learning](https://my.mindnode.com/twQ6Ft6P3rVHo1UxHwcmnx2GJQG9U7d6EgUTcKn8#-689.5,51.6,0)

- inspired by behaviourist psychology, concerned with how software agents ought to take actions in an environment so as to maximise some notion of cumulative reward  
- in machine learning, the environment is typically formulated as Markov decision process (MDP), as many reinforcement learning algorithms for this context utilise dynamic programming techniques  
	- main differences between classical techniques and reinforcement learning algorithms is that the latter do not need knowledge about the MDP and they target large MDPs where exact methods become infeasible  
- it differs from standard supervised learning in that correct input/output pairs are never presented, nor sub-optimal actions explicitly corrected  
- basic reinforcement learning model consists of :  
	1. a set of environment and agent states S  
	2. a set of actions A of the agent  
	3. policies of transitioning from states to actions  
	4. rules that determine the scalar immediate reward of a transition  
	5. rules that describe what the agent observes

## [adversarial](https://my.mindnode.com/M9XhxHJ69MHhzAXzzU6ZAj1dCSwuXsxz1xifg5LF)

- aims to enable the safe adoption of machine learning techniques in adversarial settings like spam filtering, malware detection and biometric recognition

## [datasets](https://my.mindnode.com/MJpeXC24x7tNaRuLZKiAnBhxNnWYqyzHKpyZCdpY#547.5,4.0,2)

- is a collection of data  
- most common a data set corresponds to the contents of a single database table, or a single statical data matrix, where every column of the table represents a particular variable, and each row corresponds to a given member of the data set in question

## [neural networks](https://my.mindnode.com/zLYtEZppgWfinP4p8S9LkxZsVB9kKfb38uhrXKct#-463.5,336.3,0)

- are computational models based on a large collection of simple neural units (artificial neurons), loosely analogous to the observed behaviour of a biological brain’s axons  
- each neural unit is connected with many others, and links can enhance or inhibit the activation state of adjoining neural units  
- each individual neural unit computes using summation function  
- there may be a threshold function or limiting function on each connection and on the unit itself, such that the signal must surpass the limit before propagating to there neurons  
- these systems are self learning and trained, rather than explicitly programmed, and excel in areas where the solution or feature detection is difficult to express in a traditional computer program


# [bots ✨](https://my.mindnode.com/QLEQ7cNkHc3jxyEpcLoF38jrz88twxRfrxQDc5Q5#620.0,286.5,2)

- are software agents that act for a user or other programs in relationship of agency (an agreement to act on one’s behalf)  
- they may be autonomous or work together with other agents or people  
- agents interacting with people may possess human-like qualities such as natural language understanding and speech, personality or embody humanoid form
