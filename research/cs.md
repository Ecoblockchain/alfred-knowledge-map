# [1641: computer science](https://my.mindnode.com/LRaxUSscM1rqezzRkuQ3bFayE5bxfUFt22zgK1K2)

- is the study of the theory, experimentation and engineering that form the basis for the design and use of computers  
- it is the study of automating algorithmic processes that scale


## [computation](https://my.mindnode.com/2x2sRaXapnxDkMGhz8PSDNfyeCAUSpo5VHRsagkF)

- is any type of calculation that follows a well-defined model understood and expressed as, for example, an algorithm  
- it can be seen as a purely physical phenomenon occurring inside a closed physical system called a computer  
- examples include  
	- digital computers  
	- mechanical computers  
	- quantum computers  
	- DNA computers  
	- molecular computers  
	- microfluidics-based computers   
	- analog computers  
	- or wetware computers  
- some argue that evolution of the universe itself is a computation (pancomputationalism)

### [dna computing ✨](https://my.mindnode.com/9xqFUVgF8A8PQoyyESXqaosao8TvbzDjGjp2wKiP)

- branch of computing which uses DNA, biochemistry and molecular biology hardware instead of the traditional silicon based computer technologies

### bandwidth

- is the bit-rate of available or consumed information capacity expressed typically in metric multiples of bits per second  
- the actual bit rate that can be achieved depends not only on the signal bandwidth, but also on the noise on the channel

### symbolic computation

- computer algebra system

### computational geometry

### evolutionary computation

## [hashing ✨](https://my.mindnode.com/XqGqfpvNJ2WFQdjQG3aTMyoy3xV6zuq59LMy6rFa)

- a hash function is any function that can be used to map data of arbitrary size to data of fixed size  
- the values returned by a hash function are called hash values, hash codes, digests or simply hashes  
- one use is a data structure called a hash table, widely used in computer software for rapid data lookup

## [complexity theory ✨](https://my.mindnode.com/PAE3tqyC6qZNRsfj3nszwN4yVq1TePjyK1MzZfYy)

- focuses on classifying computational problems according to their inherent difficulty, and relating those classes to each other  
- a computational problem is understood to be a task that is in principle amenable to being solved by a computer, which is equivalent to stating that the problem may be solved mechanical application of mathematical steps, such as an algorithm  
- one of the roles of computational complexity theory is to determine the practical limits on what computers can and cannot do

### [np-completeness ✨](https://my.mindnode.com/rs4s3PpJJV7nnzuZfRsTLEMc5dw2E44SqLuipyEK)

- a decision problem is NP-complete when it is both in NP and NP-hard  
- the set of NP-complete problems is often denoted by NP-C or NPC where NP refers to ‘nondeterministic polynomial time’

## [parallel computing](https://my.mindnode.com/3BixssPswKdqHt4pCqzqCqxkqLg722PgPK4TSUNR)

- is a type of computation in which many calculations or the execution of processes are carried out simultaneously  
- large problems can often be divided into smaller ones, which can then be solved at the same time  
- there are several different forms of parallel computing  
	- bit-level  
	- instruction-level  
	- data  
	- and task parallelism

## [concurrency](https://my.mindnode.com/1r5uAyLxneiV7NexzUvt5t46VhuUxvNuLH63ba5W)

- is the decomposability property of a program, algorithm or problem into order-independent or partially-ordered components or units  
	- this means that even if the concurrent units of the program, algorithm, or problem are executed out-of-order or in partial order, the final outcome will remain the same  
	- this allows for parallel execution of the concurrent units  
- design of concurrent systems often entails finding reliable techniques for coordinating their execution, data exchange, memory allocation and execution scheduling to minimise response time and maxima throughput

## programming language theory

### [formal language](https://my.mindnode.com/v1Uj7P1vgbHbTmzozuZoB2KHpazyNocazXkqdExQ)

- is a set of strings of symbols together with a set of rules that are specific to it  
- the alphabet of a formal language is the set of symbols, letters, or tokens from which the strings of the language may be formed  
	- the strings formed from this alphabet are called words, and the words that belong to a particular formal language are sometimes called well-formed words or well-formed formulas  
- a formal language is often defined by means of a formal grammar such as a regular grammar or context-free grammar, also called it formation rule

## automated theorem proving

## image processing

# [regular expressions](https://my.mindnode.com/zVrHysMLguuXix8vG2Zqi1bhAY9ypnYLzhV3aChv)

- are sequences of characters that define a search pattern  
	- usually this pattern is then used by string searching algorithms for ‘find’ or ‘find and replace’ operations on strings  
- they are used in search engines, search and replace dialogs of word processors and text editors and in text processing utilities like sed and AWK and in lexical analysis
