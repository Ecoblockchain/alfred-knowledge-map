## computational biology

## [life](https://my.mindnode.com/wXqgZ7BTL6aBAPssDhMFEGRM4qZySK92ovhTnCMQ)

- is a characteristic distinguishing physical entities having biological processes, such as signalling and self-sustaining processes, from those that do not, either because such functions have ceased, or because they never had such functions and are classified as inanimate  
- various forms of life exist, such as plants, animals, fungi, protists, archaea, and bacteria  
- the criteria can at times be ambiguous and may or may not define viruses, viroids, or potential artificial life as "living"  
- the current definition of life is that organisms maintain homeostasis, are composed of cells, undergo metabolism, can grow, adapt to their environment, respond to stimuli, and reproduce

- [artificial](https://my.mindnode.com/DwenCoEcVPRn7k1JeWtMdV4DAkn4yo5DDRDyqyzq)
  - examines systems related to natural life, its processes, and its evolution, through the use of simulations with computer models, robotics, and biochemistry

- [abiogenesis](https://my.mindnode.com/sd4fQ7CxJm1yhY2ixe4C1pdx593yx7mPxxumR7WS)
  - is the natural process by which life arises from non-living matter, such as simple organic compounds
