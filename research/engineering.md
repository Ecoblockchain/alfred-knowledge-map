# [reverse engineering ✨](https://my.mindnode.com/GUQJxf6FxsBnPbuTpYxrpgnAj4pQhTG9SJxpGssG)

- is the process of extracting knowledge or design information from anything man-made and re-producing it or re-producing anything based on the extracted information  
	- the process often involves disassembling something (a mechanical device, electronic component, computer program, or biological, chemical, or organic matter) and analysing its components and workings in details


# [engineering ✨](https://my.mindnode.com/gpVgfxR2kjRSspMrJNMKnfy1P24q4rs9LqDxPRJs)

- is the application of mathematics and scientific, economic, social and practical knowledge in order to invent, innovate, design, build, maintain and improve structures, machines, tools, systems, components, materials, processes, solutions and organisations


## [software](https://my.mindnode.com/AJpJHUt9xQxnA4hFcizyzR6NdxfD7nehRa6oxipq)

- is the application of engineering to the development of software in a systematic method

- [analytics](https://my.mindnode.com/uMPRfm98RKiP8BYrMXKCzRyo7iC4r3q4poPz4Wpc)
  - it aims to describing, predicting and improving development, maintenance and management of complex software systems  
  - methods and techniques typically rely on gathering, analysing and visualising information found in the manifold data sources in the scope of software systems and their software development processses

- [continuous delivery](https://my.mindnode.com/ppqPzVmMZQNpGLDDsLAGAnWqq76YLJdnhz3pfPrb)
  - is a software engineering approach where teams produce software in short cycles, ensuring that the software can be reliably released at any time  
  - it aims at building, testing, and releasing software faster and more frequently
