# [hacking](https://my.mindnode.com/aC1CYSVvWsSdPHaFxRaPz69Qsr8Q98SvRcxxXttu#1002.4,-314.2,2)

- someone who tries to get into another person’s computer using computer software such trojan horse programs, computer viruses and worms that can hurt other people’s computers


# [security ✨](https://my.mindnode.com/3jFXER7sziCXC5N1dQTg81jhkMdgZGypTXicggQc#723.4,-252.7,1)

- is the degree of resistance to, or protection from, harm  
- it applies to any vulnerable and/or valuable asset


## [penetration testing ✨](https://my.mindnode.com/fvq398jYzvAdQ4T1cmKnX7vDyyHkooRTyufF49w8)

- a penetration test is an authorised simulated attack on a computer system that looks for security weaknesses, potentially gaining access to the system’s features and data  
- general attack sequence in steps is  
	- find an exploitable vulnerability   
	- design an attack around it  
	- test the attack  
	- seize a line in use  
	- enter the attack  
	- exploit the entry for information recovery

## [cryptography](https://my.mindnode.com/TqyWkSgqd4Cdwcxhp7yGRSxGzGP6bkpSUTkxnDg6#846.3,-144.1,1)

- practice and study of hiding information, is used to try and keep information secret and safe  
- when a message is sent using cryptography, it is changed (or encrypted) before it is sent  
- examples algorithms include   
	- RSA  
	- AES

### [encryption](https://my.mindnode.com/ap1EMFUFCypspNBk8tywW2ckJ5kgMzLD4mcdJ6K9#350.0,-332.1,2)

- allows information to be hidden so that it cannot be read without special knowledge (such as a password), this is done with a secret code or cypher, the hidden information is said to be encrypted

### cryptanalysis

- [frequency analysis](https://my.mindnode.com/a9ABAYmcAfZpAwszsXFzWdaSgPP5h2YGp5REAAZV)
  - study of the frequency of letters or groups of letters in a ciphertext  
  - it is based on the fact that, in any given stretch of written language, certain letters and combinations of letters occur with varying frequencies  
  	- there is a characteristic distribution of letters that is roughly the same for almost all samples of that language

## [capture the flag](https://my.mindnode.com/aFDPnj4zhRzux2zsBqjsGzw5QeYxgTKkcgc7rFpe)

- a computer security competition usually designed to serve as an educational exercise to give participants experience in securing a machine, as well as conduction and reacting to the sort of attacks found in the real world

## [malware](https://my.mindnode.com/pVQngK2FS1cGhZEBhND7XkjGocB3NofrCeQ9LxJD)

- short for malicious software  
- is a kind of software that can be installed on a computer without approval from the computer’s owner
