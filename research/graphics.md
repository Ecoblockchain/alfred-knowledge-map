# [1957: virtual reality](https://my.mindnode.com/b9LbNpewXbYhQnXr2aMHgKpi81C1DSqyEDvgCNd4)

- refers to computer technologies that use virtual reality headsets to generate the realistic images, sounds and other sensations that replicate a real environment or create an imaginary setting  
- VR also simulates a user’s physical presence in this environment 


## [oculus](https://my.mindnode.com/v8FqmynzKTyAvkzdvfpzbouMdUTVs4eXLiZs9vE4)

- oculus rift is a virtual reality headset developed by Oculus VR

## [WebVR](https://my.mindnode.com/mxBVNT2vEGjxgxizzHEq3yPmoodYtxZLGJxpZvXL)

- is an experimental javascript API that provides support for virtual reality devices

- are pictures and films created using computers  
- refers to computer generated image data created with help from specialised graphical hardware and software  
- it is responsible for splaying art and image data effectively and meaningfully to the user  
	- it is also used for processing image data received from the physical word


## [opengl](https://my.mindnode.com/RRkpJ17xYLGxtPpSAHY6uJdr2V7NdjrSvjcxiS5T)

- is a cross-language, cross platform API for rendering 2D and 3D vector graphics  
- it is typically used to interact with a graphics processing unit (GPU), to achieve hardware-accelerated rendering

## [vulkan](https://my.mindnode.com/QuKC4gLuTiahH8S6bpTx3KDReMBH3EpWBdcTToHC)

- is a low-overhead, cross-platform 3D graphics and compute API first announced in 2015  
- it targets high-performance realtime 3D graphics applications such as video games and interactive media across all platforms, and can offer higher performance and more balanced CPU/GPU usage

## metal

- is a low-level, low-overhead hardware-accelerated graphics and compute application interface that debuted in iOS 8  
- it has better performance than OpenGL due to   
	- precomputed shaders and up-front state validation  
	- explicit synchronisation between GPU and CPU  
	- shared memory space between GPU and CPU  
	- lower driver overhead

## [rendering ✨](https://my.mindnode.com/2xnYJxwFM34AbKqxFs7R8PVzLJtcpQtoTgJHtaU2)

- is the process of generating an image from a 2D or 3D model (or models in what collectively could be called a scene file) by means of computer programs  
- the results of such a model can be called a rendering  
- a scene file contains objects in a strictly defined language or data structure (it would contain geometry, viewpoint, texture, lighting, and shading information as a description of the virtual scene)  
- the data contained in the scene file is then passed to a rendering program to be processed and output to a digital image or raster graphics image file

- [vector graphics](https://my.mindnode.com/WMAbr5nznMzNmTiVrTV1qbbqCf1AcsPZ5bQNsjsh)
  - is the use of polygons to represent images  
  - are based on vectors, which lead through locations called control points or nodes  
  - each of these points has a definite position on the x- and y- axes of the work place and determines the direction of the path   
  	- further, each path may be assigned various attributes, including such values as stroke colour, shape, curve, thickness and fill

## [ray tracing ✨](https://my.mindnode.com/pQxkyFqpQ8dynpcFaR2Nbz5VvrfsvpBYo9puGTwa)

- is a technique for generating an image by tracing the path of light through pixels in an image plane and simulating the effects of its encounters with virtual objects   
- the technique is capable of producing a very high degree of visual realism, usually higher than that of typical scalene rendering methods, but at a greater computational cost  
- this makes it best suited for applications where the image can be rendered slowly ahead of time, such as still images and film and television visual effects, and more poorly suited for real-time applications like video games where speed is critical  
- it is capable of simulating a wide variety of optical effects, such as reflection and refraction, scattering and dispersion phenomena (such as chromatic aberration)  
- it works by tracing a path from an imaginary eye through each pixel in a virtual screen, and calculating the colour of the object visible through it
