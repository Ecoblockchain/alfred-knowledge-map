# [space](https://my.mindnode.com/qbiHDgcMKRdwW1sfxLUzqRQ3YKab7ZrMsbLRe5qV)

- is the boundless three-dimensional extent in which objects and events have relative position and direction  
	- physical space is often conceived in three linear dimensions, although modern physicists usually consider it, with time, to be part of a bodiless four-dimensional continuum known as spacetime  
- there disagreements over wither space is itself an entity, a relationship between entities or part of a conceptual framework


## [black holes](https://my.mindnode.com/MRykcdETz9b44NS6rZkeUkiEhyiPkbqQTpH9w17h)

- is a region of spacetime exhibiting such strong gravitational effects that nothing - not even particles and electromagnetic radiation such as light - can escape from inside  
- the theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass can deform spacetime to form a black hole  
	- the boundary of the region from which no escape is possible is called the event horizon  
- black holes of stellar mass are expected to form when very massive stars collapse at the end of their life cycle

## [stars](https://my.mindnode.com/4KSp6CSqpQdRhJNzxQvjnFyUWzF3DHEym9CLdsw5)

- is a luminous sphere of plasma held together by its own gravity  
- the most prominent stars were grouped into constellations and asterisms  
- most of the stars in the Universe, including all stars outside our galaxy, the Milky Way, are invisible to the naked eye from Earth  
- for at least a portion of its life, a star shines due to thermonuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium in its core, releasing energy that traverses the star's interior and then radiates into outer space

### [sun](https://my.mindnode.com/7f7y7Hx9f3wGydM9DGJ4nyRR6piSttTp2xjEcZzm)

- is the star at the centre of the Solar System  
- it is nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma, with internal convective motion that generates a magnetic field via a dynamo process  
- it is by far the most important source of energy for life on Earth

## [galaxies](https://my.mindnode.com/DpAsGBaYpqxysaMfzPXZsUxotRyYKQSPwtf2cXKh)

- is gravitationally bound system of stars, stellar remnants, interstellar gas, dust, and dark matter  
- they range in size from dwarfs with just a few billion stars, to giants with one hundred trillion stars, each orbiting its galaxy's centre of mass  
- are categorised according to their visual morphology as elliptical, spiral and irregular  
- estimates of the number of galaxies in the observable universe range from 200 billion to 2 trillion or more, containing more stars than all the grains of sand on planet earth  
- the space between galaxies is filled with a tenuous gas having an average density of less than one atom per cubic meter  
- the majority of galaxies are gravitationally organised into groups, clusters, and superclusters  
- at the largest scale, these associations are generally arranged into sheets and filaments surrounded by immense voids  
- the largest structure of galaxies yet recognised is a cluster of superclusters, that has been named Laniakea

### [milky way](https://my.mindnode.com/CVP1RtB9Wsfuo7a9pqqyqQ8tAsFzDxZwRjLZfHsC)

- is the galaxy that contains our Solar System  
- it is a barred spiral galaxy with a diameter between 100,000 light-years and 180,000 light-years  
	- it is estimated to contain 100–400 billion stars  
- it is located within the disk, about 26,000 light-years from the Galactic Centre  
- the very centre is marked by an intense radio source, named Sagittarius A*, which is likely to be a supermassive black hole

- [solar system](https://my.mindnode.com/Hs5RfJ4eAxxybYFNYX3JyDUE9Tqjga9WwUy9sEsp)
  - is the gravitationally bound system comprising the Sun and the objects that orbit it, either directly or indirectly  
  - it formed 4.6 billion years ago from the gravitational collapse of a giant interstellar molecular cloud

### [1612: andromeda](https://my.mindnode.com/Q4nQ3yB411RDshqNFoqXMxRGz9syVHHL954QHhCg)

- is a spiral galaxy approximately 780 kiloparsecs (2.5 million light-years) from Earth  
- It is the nearest major galaxy to the Milky Way  
- it is approximately 220,000 light years across, and it is the largest galaxy of the Local Group, which also contains the Milky Way, the Triangulum Galaxy, and other smaller galaxies  
- The Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies are expected to collide in 4.5 billion years, eventually merging to form a giant elliptical galaxy or perhaps a large disc galaxy


# astronomy

- studies celestial objects and phenomena   
- applies mathematics, physics and chemistry, in effort to explain the origin of those objects and phenomena and their evolution  
- objects of interest include planets, moons, stars, galaxies and comets  
	- while the phenomena include supernovae explosions, gamma ray bursts and cosmic microwave background radiation


# [universe](https://my.mindnode.com/W2fPJssX4R4APsFNJaLRk6xVk5eysLHrCwtfjsQy)

- is all of the time and space and its contents  
- it includes planets, moons, minor planets, stars, galaxies, the contents of intergalactic space and all matter and energy  
- the size of the entire universe is unknown
