# [quantum computing](https://my.mindnode.com/MLQopPH5DasNfaHqszs2PMSk9Kp2qxxP3sLCiR29)

- studies theoretical computation systems (quantum computers) that make direct use of quantum-mechanical phenomena, such as superposition and entanglement, to perform operations on data  
- they are different from binary digital electronic computers based on transistors   
	- whereas common digital computing requires that the data be encoded into binary digits (bits), each of which is always in one two definite states (0 or 1), quantum computation uses quantum bits, which can be in superpositions of states  
- a quantum turing machine is a theoretical model of such computer, and is also known as the universal quantum computer   
- a single quit can represent a one, a zero, or any quantum superposition of those two quit states


- [quantum information](https://my.mindnode.com/ix2qvkPMTfSeiaJJ2cyak353YMdcxR2DVdp4myyB)
  - is information that is held in the state of a quantum system  
  - it differs strongly from classical information, epitomised by the bit, in many striking and unfamiliar ways


# [1913: quantum mechanics](https://my.mindnode.com/ERpHGrFNVdbKLZWAh1wi6etQxDY3QRrcrgs3oz7e)

- is the fundamental theory of nature at small scales and low energies of atoms and subatomic particles  
- classical physics derives from quantum mechanics as an approximation valid only at large (macroscopic) scales  
- quantum mechanics differs from classical physics in that energy, momentum and other quantities are often restricted to discrete values (quantisation), objects have characteristics of both particles and waves (wave-particle duality) and there are limits to the precision with which quantities can be   
known (uncertainty principle)


- [string theory](https://my.mindnode.com/SR2Z6ndrhp1gZRayycWksJEBzPcujR3xr7kWLfT9)
  - is a theoretical framework in which the point-like particles or particle physics are replaced by one-dimensional objects called strings  
  	- it describes how these strings propagate through space and interact with each other  
  	- on distance scales large than the string scale, a string looks just like an ordinary particle, with its mass, charge and other properties determined by the vibrational state of the string  
  	- one of the many vibrational states of the string corresponds to the graviton, a quantum mechanical particle that carries gravitational force

- [spin](https://my.mindnode.com/sDbRjiYXfC12qpF6efAn9sKpk2XyTdWFvwDeksph)
  - is an intrinsic form of angular momentum carried by elementary particles, composite particles (hadrons) and atomic nuclei  
  - spin is one of two types of angular momentum in quantum mechanics, the other being orbital angular momentum  
  - in some ways, spins is like a vector quantity; it has a definite magnitude, and it has a ‘direction’ (but quantisation makes this ‘direction’ different from the direction of an ordinary vector)

- [loop quantum gravity](https://my.mindnode.com/epQWaVyJaSPzY3CGp5zmzxyw4StBHtqDu1i5BT8o)
  - is a theory that attempt to describe the quantum properties of the universe and gravity  
  - it is also a theory of quantum spacetime because according to general relativity, gravity is a manifestation of the geometry of spacetime  
  - it is an attempt to merge quantum mechanics and general relativity

- [quantum entanglement](https://my.mindnode.com/PziyFKPQ95zurH7VAnqKFxGLH96yCkZwcv2D2SwN)
  - is a physical phenomenon that occurs when pairs or groups of particles are generated or interact in ways such that the quantum state of each particle cannot be described independently of the others, even when the particles are separated by a large distance   
  	- instead, a quantum state must be described for the system as a whole

- [quantum field theory ✨](https://my.mindnode.com/Y2ZrpZdcqTzUyzAfx2w3T6mr1VrDQbHhAaGxDUV3)
  - is the theoretical framework for constructing quantum mechanical models of subatomic particles in particle physics and quasiparticles in condensed matter physics  
  - it treats particles as excited states of the underlying physical field, so these are called field quanta

- [bloch sphere](https://my.mindnode.com/TYQv7runzBk67VHq7ChTBKNbuwoRNf6kvWGs4Tg5)
  - is a geometrical representation of the pure state space of a two-level quantum mechanical system (qubit)  
  - quantum mechanics is mathematically formulated in Hilbert space or projective Hilbert space  
  	- the space of pure states of a quantum system is given by the one-dimensional subspaces of the corresponding Hilbert space (or the ‘points’ of the projective Hilbert space)  
  	- for a two-dimensional Hilbert space, this is simply the complex projective line CP which is the Bloch sphere

- uncertainty principle

- atomic orbital
