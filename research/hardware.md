## circuits

### integrated

- [cpu](https://my.mindnode.com/pyCGxUdYXPJoXKp6N6wSoeUA4pC8HmMskuqvgspV)
  - is the electronic circuitry within a computer that carries out the instructions of a computer program by performing the basic arithmetic, loci, control and input/output (I/O) operations specified by the instructions   
  - principal components of a CPU include   
  	- the arithmetic logic unit (ALU) that performs arithmetic and logic operations  
  	- processor registers that supply operands to the ALU and store the results of ALU operations  
  	- and a control unit that orchestrates the fetching (from memory) and execution of instructions by directing the coordinated operations of the ALU, registers and other components

- [tpu](https://my.mindnode.com/1bRFdkzXxcY9XYDxZnhMcDywAyqj7XtBS6rprzws)
  - tensor processing units are application-specific integrated circuits developed specifically for machine learning  
  - the chip has been specifically designed for Google’s TensorFlow framework

- fpga
  - a field-programmable gate array is an integrated circuit designed to be configured by a customer or a designer after manufacturing – hence "field-programmable"  
  - its configuration is generally specified using a hardware description language (HDL), similar to that used for an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC)


# [technology](https://my.mindnode.com/aEEzqyr6AexX3KCiaz1q23wTpwzrr9nXqpBs1dky)

- is the collection of techniques, skills, methods and processes used in the production of goods or services or in the accomplishment of objectives, such as scientific investigation  
- human specie’s use of technology began with the conversion of natural resources into simple tools


# [robotics](https://my.mindnode.com/aGwNAy62qd6FVsXxWG4utF95QSRsmypNtuKFzpdq)

- deals with design, construction, operation and use of robots, as well as computer systems for their control, sensory feedback, and information processing  
- these technologies are used to develop machines that can substitute for humans  
- robots can be used in any situation and for any purpose


# [09: raspberry pi](https://my.mindnode.com/jVPUvSKExr9FG5PHgxqzecXUrcuac7QMFjFSmr7n)

- is a series of small single-board computers

# [hardware ✨](https://my.mindnode.com/rnXcxGZ1LQGdHupqvXTsZpgVh4fpgxia5Ke3y6bM)

- computer hardware is the collection of physical components that constitute a computer system  
- it is the physical parts or components of a computer, such as monitor, keyboard, computer data storage, graphic card, sound card, motherboard and so on, all of which are tangible objects  
- hardware is directed by software to execute any command or instruction


## [gpu](https://my.mindnode.com/qrRQjspUTfSxUYRutiPtArZ5HWTNgVihVuepqGZc)

- is a specialised electronic circuit designed to rapidly manipulate and alter memory to accelerate the creation of images in a frame buffer intended for output to display device  
- they are very efficient at manipulating computer graphics and image processing, and their highly parallel structure makes them more efficient than general-purpose CPUs for algorithms where the processing of large blocks of data is done in parallel

### [cuda](https://my.mindnode.com/UzsD8fPyLmedeobRhtjqAygoxdZn9fD86WtFfAVS#-242.9,-144.7,2)

- is a parallel computing platform and API model created by Nvidia   
- it allows software developers and software engineers to use a CUDA-enabled GPU for general purpose processing

## [memory](https://my.mindnode.com/WvTF5x4kKPzssXAftPcsaoqU5UDXjE2qyJzcZ7EK)

- refers to computer hardware devices used to store information for immediate use in a computer

### [cache](https://my.mindnode.com/fQ1XBzCUgn4Vhz6pJfe9GuFdxCCDrJ5szhuYpQTG)

- is a fast and relatively small memory, not visible to the software, that is completely handled by the hardware, that stores the most recently used (MRU) main memory (MM) (or working memory) data  
- the function of cache memory is to speed up the MM data access and to reduce the system bus and MM traffic in multiprocessor systems (which is one of the major bottlenecks of these systems)


# [embedded systems](https://my.mindnode.com/4gmb9Dk6QN2NFmuHpzmRDbGj8ypj2Xv9zEqqZg42)

- is a computer system with a dedicated function within a larger mechanical or electrical system, often with real-time computing constrains  
- it is embedded as part of a complete device often including hardware and mechanical parts


## [microcontrollers](https://my.mindnode.com/R3NHfx7fU9pDRtyQKyqpAxro7qJpgBPNyZtQrqLB)

- are small computers on a single integrated circuit  
	- it is a system on a chip  
- it contains one or more CPUs (processor cores) along with memory and programmable input/output peripherals
