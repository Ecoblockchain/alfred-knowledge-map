- [ring theory](https://my.mindnode.com/H7uZZ1syPfDBHyKspWf7qjKM4z9KQ8UA8hSHwbom)

- [lie groups](https://my.mindnode.com/L9HGQrVat5LGtq3igzNqtfswz8ifqjyMbvxSF9qn)
  - is a group that is also a differentiable manifold, with the property that the group operations are compatible with the smooth structure  
  - lie groups are smooth differentiable manifolds and as such can be studied using differential calculus, in contrast with the case of more general topological groups  
  	- one of the key ideas in the theory of Lie groups is to replace the global object, the group, with its local or linearised version

- [representation theory](https://my.mindnode.com/rtP2zyWvKfBt61nqLKxCjEuphAqp78PGum9TtGoS)
  - studies abstract algebraic structures by representing their elements as linear transformations of vector spaces, and studies modules over these abstract algebraic structures  
  - a representation makes an abstract algebraic object more concrete by describing its elements by matrices and the algebraic operations in terms of matrix addition and matrix multiplication  
  - representation theory is a useful method because it reduces problems in abstract algebra to problems in linear algebra (which is more well understood)

## [universal](https://my.mindnode.com/bWV1m6GCx3kbBcRVsEUAEDupWpTjj4SssRuJWFTA)

- studies algebraic structures themselves, not examples (‘models’) of algebraic structures  
	- for instance, rather than take particular groups as the object of study, in universal algebra on takes the ‘theory of groups’ as an object of study  
- in universal algebra, an algebra (or algebraic structure) is a set A together with a collection of operations on A

## elementary

- considered to be essential for any study of mathematics, science, or engineering  
- differed from arithmetic in the use of abstractions, such as using letters to stand for numbers that are either unknown or allowed to take on many values


# [information theory](https://my.mindnode.com/sV2rmysskLGTGzZjfckp3ouCeyyUEnyC2eTfiH5x)

- studies the quantification, storage and communication of information  
- a key measure in information theory is ‘entropy’  
	- entropy quantifies the amount of uncertainty involved in the value of a random variable or the outcome of a random process  
	- i. e. identifying the outcome of a fair coin flip (with two equally likely outcomes) provides less information (lower entropy) than specifying the outcome from a roll of a die (with six equally likely outcomes)


## [algorithmic information theory](https://my.mindnode.com/vfXkctqPxGnnpZUnHQooLujkSJ6mPQfHspxx7sHZ)

- concerns itself with relationship between computation and information   
- it is the ‘result of putting Shannon’s information theory and Turing’s computability theory together’  
- it studies complexity measures on strings (or other data structures)  
	- as most mathematical objects can be described in terms of strings, or as the limit of a sequence of strings, it can be used to study a wide variety of mathematical objects, including integers


# ~[1930: lambda calculus](https://my.mindnode.com/T3szxY2FvQRQEkxRdH5HPx66mzDgwfHfCdzMsSXJ)

- are relations between a set of inputs and a set of permissible outputs with the property that each input is related to exactly one output  
	- i. e. a function that relates each real number x to its square x²  
- a function is defined by its set of inputs, called the domain; a set of outputs, and possible additional elements, as members, called its codomain; and the set of all input-output pairs, called its graph  
- they are the ‘central objects of investigation’ in mathematics


## [taylor series ✨](https://my.mindnode.com/ELq3xbSpb8JNynMCMUgQzccGexDc5548pu1DRWdL)

- is a representation of a function as an infinite sum of terms that are calculated from the values of the function’s derivatives at a single point  
- a function can be approximated by using a finite number of terms of its Taylor series  
- it is a real or complex-valued function f(x) that is infinitely differentiable at a real or complex number a in the power series

- usually done by using computers to make static two or three dimensional drawings, animations or interactive programs


# [operator theory](https://my.mindnode.com/of3fxpbV9ceAHzsR8ksajrCmsQiiKGSGx7eTzUvX)

- is the study of linear operators on function spaces, beginning with differential operators and integral operators  
	- the operators may be presented abstractly by their characteristics, such as bounded linear operators or closed operators, and consideration may be given to nonlinear operators  
- if a collection of operators forms an algebra over a field, then it is an operator algebra


# [1940: category theory ✨](https://my.mindnode.com/1ZNruQzLV5bsrLYhY6VgsydH1r29YS1XgmeLKPaa)

- formalises mathematical structure and its concepts in terms of a collection of objects and of arrows (also called morphisms)  
- a category has two basic properties  
	1. the ability to compose the arrows associatively   
	2. and the existence of an identity arrow for each object  
- the language of category theory has been used to formalise concepts of other high-level abstractions such as sets, rings and groups  
- in category theory, morphisms obey conditions specific to category theory itself  
- it has practical applications in programming language theory, in particular for the study of monads in functional programming


# [queueing theory](https://my.mindnode.com/KdDiVLY2oKFApemg68zAWr7qvqgZ1p6gr3h5tDqn)

- is the study of waiting lines or queues  
- it queueing theory, a model is constructed so that queue lengths and waiting time can be predicted


# [1975: fractals ✨](https://my.mindnode.com/8suTHRqawXHqDPGAVYsxCAfbRQo6ZcGvCPvZ5vkp)

- is a mathematical set that exhibits a repeating pattern displayed at every scale  
- is also known as expanding symmetry or evolving symmetry  
- if the replication is exactly the same at every scale, it is called a self-similar pattern (i.e. Menger Sponge)  
	- fractals can also be nearly the same at different levels   
- they include the idea of a detailed pattern that repeats itself  
- they are different from other geometric figures because of the way in which they scale  
	- doubling the edge lengths of a polygon multiples its area by four, which is two (the ratio of the new to the old side length) raised to the power of two (here the dimension of the space the polygon resides in)  
	- likewise, if the radius of a sphere is doubled, its volume scales by eight (to the power of its dimension)  
	- this power is called the fractal dimension of the fractal and it usually exceeds the fractal’s topological dimension  
- they are usually nowhere differentiable  
	- an infinite fractal curve can be conceived of as winding through space differently from an ordinary line, still being a 1-dimensional line yet having a fractal dimension indication it also resembles a surface


# [notation](https://my.mindnode.com/zzJBWaA5nkYYgAYLLMrudq73ps5PkQnPKu8HpZfr)

- is a system of graphics or symbols, characters and abbreviated expressions, used in artistic and scientific disciplines to represent technical facts and quantities by convention  
- it is a collection of related symbols that are each given an arbitrary meaning, created to facilitate structured communication within a domain knowledge or field of study


# [theories](https://my.mindnode.com/DxRPEnem49ZwUxyTnfijwE5Mi9gFjN4dBZ2xgy25)

- is a contemplative and rational type of abstract or generalising thinking, or the results of such thinking  
- they guide the enterprise of finding facts rather than of reaching goals, and are neutral concerning alternatives among values  
- they are analytical tools for understanding, explaining and making predictions about a given subject matter


# [proofs](https://my.mindnode.com/XyTDyytxnnniBnQAEyMcCpyqs77sxMqmSfeXu56y)

- is an inferential argument for a mathematical statement  
- in the argument, other previously established statements, such as theorems, can be used  
- a proof can be traced back to self-evident or assumed statements, known as axioms, along with accepted rules of inference  
	- axioms may be treated as conditions that must be met before the statement applies  
- they are examples of exhaustive deductive reasoning or inductive reasoning  
- a proof must demonstrate that a statement is always true (occasionally by listing all possible cases and showing that it holds in each), rather that enumerate many confirmatory cases


## [induction](https://my.mindnode.com/fUnyydZRSrXfQnXtqFj7YDRdDqsD4LootHq1VpAJ)

- is a proof technique used to prove a given statement about any well-ordered set
