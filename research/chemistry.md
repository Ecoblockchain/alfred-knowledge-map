# [chemistry](https://my.mindnode.com/wYDhE6MqsqRDVpw5CEEJULsjxHkqNFZad3DvDhYr#392.6,-220.4,2)

- studies the composition, structure, properties and change of matter  
- it includes topics such as the properties of individual atoms, how atoms form chemical bonds to create chemical compounds, the interactions of substances through intermolecular forces that give matter its general properties, and the interactions between substances through chemical reactions to form different substances


## [compounds](https://my.mindnode.com/Mp1YiKoPGthEkykex4qQx6QnB2iaYfLKFu9S5H2C#-107.9,117.9,2)

- are entities consisting of two or more atoms, at least two from different elements, which associate via chemical bonds  
- there are four types of compounds, depending on how the constituent atoms are held together :  
	- molecules held together by covalent bonds  
	- ionic compounds held by ionic bonds  
	- inter metallic compounds held together by metallic bonds  
	- and certain complexes held together by coordinate covalent bonds  
- many chemical compounds have a unique numerical identifier assigned by the Chemical Abstracts Service  
	- its CAS number

## [elements](https://my.mindnode.com/s2t5UnPoUS3CA5BFqvsyqkEnynxCMAspAj2v3VEN)

- is a species of atoms having the same number of protons in their atomic nuclei (i.e. same atomic number, ùõß)  
- there are 118 elements that have been identified, of which 94 occur naturally on Earth with the remaining 24 being synthetic elements  
	- there are 80 elements that have at least one stable isotope and 38 that have exclusively radioactive isotopes, which decay over time into other elements  
- chemical elements constitute all of the ordinary matter of the universe  
	- however astronomical observations suggest that ordinary observable matter makes up only about 15% of the matter in the universe  
	- the remainder is dark matter (composition of this is unknown, but it is not composed of chemical elements)  
	

## [quantum chemistry](https://my.mindnode.com/HLh4asnpQJ4bFAKKaspqsyF62udVQbx7qgqPTe3M)

- focuses on the application of quantum mechanics in physical models and experiments of chemical systems

## reactions

- is a process that leads to the transformation of one set of chemical substances to another  
- they encompass changes that only involve the positions of electrons in the forming and breaking of chemical bonds between atoms, with no change to the nuclei (no change to the elements present), and can often be described by a chemical equation

- [redox](https://my.mindnode.com/XNs8XpLidz3eMNjWNu2FhshnywiPLPqWAcyqhnr4)
  - is a chemical reaction in which the oxidation states of atoms are changed  
  - any such reaction involves both a reduction process and a complementary oxidation process, two key concepts involved with electron transfer processes  
  - they include all chemical reactions in which atoms have their oxidation state changed  
  	- this involves the transfer of electrons between chemical species  
  - the chemical species from which the electron is stripped is said to have been oxidised, while the chemical species to which the electron is added is said to have been reduced  
  - oxidation   
  	- is the loss of electrons or an increase in oxidation state by a molecule, atom, or ion  
  - reduction   
  	- is the gain of electrons or a decrease in oxidation state by a molecule, atom, or ion

## molecules

- is an electrically neutral group of two or more atoms held together by chemical bonds  
- they are distinguished from ions by their lack of electrical charge

- [molecular symmetry ‚ú®](https://my.mindnode.com/Ayzozn7zGsp7LGuqPGyY8kR1AEtiywbJqDiyWxS1)
  - describes the symmetry present in molecules and the classification of molecules according to their symmetry  
  - it is a fundamental concept in chemistry, as it can predict or explain many of a molecule's chemical properties, such as its dipole moment and its allowed spectroscopic transitions (based on selection rules such as the Laporte rule)  
  - various frameworks for the study of molecular symmetry exist, group theory is the predominant one

- [polymers](https://my.mindnode.com/GeXjnpRb5iJz1YiJHgb64scXzic3sNbu3cJRzeGR)
  - is a large molecule, or macromolecule, composed of many repeated subunits  
  - they range from familiar synthetic plastics such as polystyrene to natural biopolymers such as DNA and proteins that are fundamental to biological structure and function  
  - polymers, both natural and synthetic, are created via polymerisation of many small molecules, known as monomers  
  	- their consequently large molecular mass relative to small molecule compounds produces unique physical properties, including toughness, viscoelasticity, and a tendency to form glasses and semicrystalline structures rather than crystals

# [drugs](https://my.mindnode.com/cySRz6ygp55zqaDBC3nXWZCszQqAqG7qbKJB2jbD)

- is any substance (other than food that provides nutritional support) that, when inhaled, injected, smoked, consumed, absorbed via a patch on the skin, or dissolved under the tongue, causes a physiological change in the body  
- psychoactive drugs are chemical substances that affect the function of the central nervous system, altering perception, mood or consciousness


## [psychedelics ‚ú®](https://my.mindnode.com/twLboGdPHhGmh3rbtx9Qgxx89Zc5msPzDsuxkPye)

- is a drug whose primary action is to alter cognition and perception, typically by agonising serotonin receptors  
- not to be confused with psychoactive drugs, such as stimulants and opioids, which induce familiar states of consciousness, psychedelics tend to affect the mind in ways that result in the experience being qualitatively different from those of ordinary consciousness  
- the psychedelic experience is often compared to non-ordinary forms of consciousness such as trance, meditation, yoga, religious ecstasy, dreaming and even near-death experiences

- [lysergamide](https://my.mindnode.com/fDqnq3VDcDRpPw5LoH6T5pBHnhwBYFzzxnMZaoMp)
  - refers to a class of compounds derived from alkaloids of a group of fungi known as ergot in the claviceps genus

- [tryptamine](https://my.mindnode.com/4vDdBrQUaHvRqxbvVs6ekfoRBZSJBz5txLK2ZZmh)
  - is a monoamine alkaloid found in animals, plants and fungi  
  	- substituted tryptamine refers to a class of compounds which are typically capable of producing strong psychedelic and entheogenic effects

- [entactogen](https://my.mindnode.com/TfXq4xG4LbPKYgpUCGGFgUCn6XpyTujCzwUmyu5G)
  - is used to describe a class of psychoactive drugs that produce distinctive emotional and social effects similar to those of MDMA

- [microdosing](https://my.mindnode.com/2CAaVhiRfhEWzkqWEhtswpFqQQxw28SKyXWcAavS)
  - are sub-perceptual doses which are so low that they are unlikely to induce directly noticeable or perceptible effects

## [research chemicals](https://my.mindnode.com/3n4kmWxihzdPpXFsLYCwRvqcAq7suzJxfBAznssE)

- are psychoactive substances which have undergone little to no scientific and medical studies

## stimulants

- are psychoactive substances that predominantly increase activity in the brain and induce temporary alterations in either mental or physical function or both  
	- examples of these kinds of effects may include enhanced alertness, wakefulness, and locomotion, among others

- phenethylamine
  - is a trace amine and influencer of many neurotransmitters, such as dopamine and serotonin  
  - it is an important molecule in the brain, but is not often used as a supplement because it is rapidly broken down into inactive components

- amphetamine 
  - is a strong central nervous system stimulant that increases activity in the brain and induces temporary improvements such as enhanced alertness, wakefulness, and locomotion

## [nootropics](https://my.mindnode.com/fNqDjrMDXd9bMxU1p8G1mDsh1WhXqxQJNNFppxpX)

- are drugs, supplements, nutraceuticals, and functional foods that purportedly improve mental functions such as cognition, memory, intelligence, motivation, attention, and concentration  
- they are thought to work by altering the availability of the brain's supply of neurochemicals (neurotransmitters, enzymes, and hormones), by improving the brain's oxygen supply, or by stimulating nerve growth  
- the following criteria is used to determine whether or not a substance fits its ‚Äònootropic‚Äô descriptor   
	- enhancement of learning and memory function  
	- improvement of learned behaviours when conditions are set to disrupt them (e.g. administering an amnesiac)  
	- must be neuroprotective  
	- must be extremely low in toxicity, with few to no side effects

## [antibiotics](https://my.mindnode.com/dTpsaz4v4W67qLVeXzTsgWNZzqaRCepzehzkvzjs)

- are a type of antimicrobial drug used in the treatment and prevention of bacterial infections  
- they may either kill or inhibit the growth of bacteria

- are organic compounds with four rings arranged in a specific configuration  
- they have two principal biological functions :  
	- certain steroids (such as cholesterol) are important components of cell membranes which alter membrane fluidity  
	- and many steroids are signalling molecules which activate steroid hormone receptors
