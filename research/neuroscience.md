# [1960: neuroscience ✨](https://my.mindnode.com/tpKRHB3qKyyKHrgCT8bWYuyz4gqjprLbgenBfQDN#-1068.2,-988.4,2)

- is the scientific study of the nervous system  
- it studies the molecular, cellular, developmental, structural, functional, evolutionary, computational, psychosocial and medical aspects of the nervous system


## [brain computer interface](https://my.mindnode.com/8BvABzGKgpcYmsvxp6kVvuWmHuQ2ov33DQq1QQMp)

- is a direct communication pathway between an enhanced or wired brain and an external device  
- they are often directed at researching, mapping, assisting, augmenting, or repairing human cognitive or sensory-motor functions

## [memory ✨](https://my.mindnode.com/dyFyVwr6e1mBUNWL5HWuuMbMyNgwnKNwHqG3BbY2)

- is the faculty of the mind by which information is encoded, stored, and retrieved  
- it is vital to experiences and related to limbic systems, it is the retention of information over time for the purpose of influencing future action  
	- if we could not remember past events, we could not learn or develop language, relationships, nor personal identity  
- it is understood as an informational processing system with explicit and implicit functioning that is made up of a sensory processor, short-term (or working) memory, and long-term memory

## [sleep](https://my.mindnode.com/S2GoddXvkAbq2NkTWszTk52CB3iqcnyzGxeMUVJa)

- is a naturally recurring state of mind and body characterised by altered consciousness, relatively inhibited sensory activity, inhibition of nearly all voluntary muscles, and reduced interactions with surroundings  
- it occurs in repeating periods, in which the body alternates between two highly distinct modes known as non-REM and REM sleep  
	- REM stands for "rapid eye movement"  
- during sleep, most systems are in an anabolic state, helping to restore the immune, nervous, skeletal, and muscular systems

### [dreaming](https://my.mindnode.com/xtqSJ9S78ZQB9GG35jnUmHUqR1xdb561zTVPpRyQ)

- is the process of experiencing a dream during sleep

- [lucid](https://my.mindnode.com/3wWWq3fvM4acGHakP7iWMJsyDqy3VUzjuUkxpXq5)
  - is a dream during which the dreamer is aware of dreaming  
  - during lucid dreaming, the dreamer may be able to exert some degree of control over the dream characters, narrative, and environment

## [addiction](https://my.mindnode.com/WPBuHKWttyoukpSPSRu8q8mypxKGeaMqhAZ5cvWs)

- is a brain disorder characterised by compulsive engagement in rewarding stimuli, despite adverse consequences  
- despite the involvement of a number of psychosocial factors, a biological process – one which is induced by repeated exposure to an addictive stimulus – is the core pathology that drives the development and maintenance of an addiction  
- the two properties that characterise all addictive stimuli are that they are   
	- reinforcing (i.e., they   
increase the likelihood that a person will seek repeated exposure to them)   
	- and intrinsically rewarding (i.e., perceived as being positive or desirable)

## [habits](https://my.mindnode.com/VLUhpGz7vDLAjF5smkTLt1WGbEqSidD7GoF42pnP)

- is a routine of behaviour that is repeated regularly and tends to occur subconsciously

## [neurotransmitters](https://my.mindnode.com/qcoqRoDpkRevTy2cZ86PRhtA5sqcpcyGVKbp2Kdp)

- are endogenous chemicals that enable neurotransmission  
- they transmit signals across a chemical synapse, such as a neuromuscular junction, from one neuron (nerve cell) to another "target" neuron, muscle cell, or gland cell  
- they are released from synaptic vesicles in synapses into the synaptic cleft, where they are received by receptors on the target cells  
- many neurotransmitters are synthesized from simple and plentiful precursors such as amino acids, which are readily available from the diet and only require a small number of biosynthetic steps for conversion  
- their exact numbers are unknown, but more than 100 chemical messengers have been uniquely identified

### [serotonin](https://my.mindnode.com/MbJsK1PUbdSgQjunGFoNdoV8epyvivhHoZYvmP8q)

- is a monoamine neurotransmitter  
- biochemically derived from tryptophan, serotonin is primarily found in the gastrointestinal tract (GI tract), blood platelets, and the central nervous system of animals, including humans  
	- it is popularly thought to be a contributor to feelings of well-being and happiness

### [dopamine](https://my.mindnode.com/xqZQ2ozXsuY5QCuzC8atUWaBfsFSVcHtEyHRWbcs)

- is an organic chemical of the catecholamine and phenethylamine families that plays several important roles in the brain and body  
- it is an amine synthesised by removing a carboxyl group from a molecule of its precursor chemical L-DOPA, which is synthesised in the brain and kidneys  
- it is also synthesised in plants and most multicellular animals

## [cognition](https://my.mindnode.com/xyMqiupnAsbdKJNzaTg4k2Dgim7qHsFwhuBYSRJk)

- is the mental action or process of acquiring knowledge and understanding through thought, experience, and the senses  
- it encompasses processes such as knowledge, attention, memory and working memory, judgment and evaluation, reasoning and "computation", problem solving and decision making, comprehension and production of language  
- human cognition is conscious and unconscious, concrete or abstract, as well as intuitive (like knowledge of a language) and conceptual (like a model of a language)  
- cognitive processes use existing knowledge and generate new knowledge

## [disorders](https://my.mindnode.com/KqktP1jc4dEyZtZRQ34BxfXAwH5gZ9nQ3iyiGpBg)

- is a derangement or abnormality of function; a morbid physical or mental state
