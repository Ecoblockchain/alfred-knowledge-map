- is a time series consisting of a sequence of quantities  
	- it is a time series that is a function over a domain of integers  
- unlike a continuous-time signal, a discrete-time signal is not a function of a continuous argument  
- they may have several origins, but can usually be classified into one of two groups  
	- by acquiring values of an analog signal at constant or variable rate (this process is called Sampling)  
	- by observing an inherently discrete-time process, such as the weekly peak value of a particular economic indicator

## signal to noise ratio

- is a measure that compares the level of a desired signal to the level of background noise  
	- it is defined as the ration of signal power to the noise power, often expressed in decibels

	- the laws of physics are invariant (i.e. identical) in all inertial systems (non-accelerating frames of reference)  
	- the speed of light in a vacuum is the same for all observers, regardless of the motion of the light source  
- the theory is ‘special’ in that it only applies in the special case where the curvature of spacetime due to gravity is negligible

### general relativity

- is the geometric theory of gravitation and is the current description of gravitation in modern physics  
- it generalises special relativity and Newton’s law of universal gravitation, providing a unified description of gravity as a geometry property of space and time, or spacetime  
- the curvature of spacetime is directly related to the energy and momentum of whatever matter and radiation are present  
- the relation is specified by the Einstein field equations, a system of partial differential equations

## [gravity](https://my.mindnode.com/VUyUTfxgXZ5p5hqFm5dDqPxSqqfyuh7yzp6KGSSX)

- is a natural phenomenon by which all things with mass are brought toward (or gravitate toward) one another, including planets, stars and galaxies

	- elastic energy stored by stretching solid objects  
	- chemical energy released when fuel burns  
	- radiant energy carried by light  
	- and thermal energy due to an object’s temperature

- it is the quantum excitation of the Higgs field  
	- unlike other known fields such as the electromagnetic field, it has a non-zero constant value in vacuum  
	- the presence of this field, now confirmed by experimental investigation, explains why some fundamental particles have mass when, based on the symmetries controlling their interactions, they should be masses  
- in the Standard Model, the Higgs particle is a boson with no spin, electric charge, or colour charge  
	- it is also very unstable, decaying into other particles almost immediately

- it has zero rest mass and is always moving at the speed of light  
- they exhibit properties of both waves and particles  
	- i.e. a single photon may be refracted by a lens and exhibit wave interference with itself, and it can behave as a particle with definite and finite measurable position and momentum  
- photons and other elementary particles are described as a necessary consequence of physical laws having a certain symmetry at every point in spacetime

- is an oscillation accompanied by a transfer of energy that travels through a medium (space or mass)  
- frequency refers to the addition of time  
- wave motion transfers energy from one point to another, which displace particles of the transmission medium (that is, with little or no associated mass transport)  
- waves consist, instead, of oscillations or vibrations (of a physical quantity) around almost fixed locations  
- there two main types of waves  
	- mechanical waves propagate through a medium, and the substance of this medium is deformed  
	- and electromagnetic waves which do not require a medium  
		- instead they consist of periodic oscillations of electrical and magnetic fields originally generated by charged particles, and can therefore travel through a vacuum

### [radio](https://my.mindnode.com/rAtdoZPcf9x4cyzbv3FunmHyZ5sjK5jchF8nzswp)

- is a physical quantity, typically a number or tensor, that has a value for each point in space and time  
- in quantum theory of fields, a field occupies space, contains energy, and its presence precludes a classical ‘true vacuum’

- it is often categorised as either ionising or non-ionising depending on the energy of the radiated particles

## [antimatter](https://my.mindnode.com/TaYApZzCDVHkk6y5gVgPQvqPbRzTTUmmy7d5p1wg)

- is a material composed of antiparticle ‘partners’ to the corresponding particles of ordinary matter  
- a particle and its antiparticle have the same mass as one another, but opposite electric charge and other quantum numbers  
	- i.e. a proton has positive charge while an antiproton has negative charge  
- a collision between any particle and its antiparticle partner leads to their mutual annihilation, giving rise to various proportions of intense photons (gamma rays), neutrinos and sometimes less-massive particle-antiparticle pairs  
	- the consequence of annihilation is a release of energy available for heat or work, proportional to the total matter and antimatter mass, in accord with the mass-energy equivalence equation, E = mc²

	- the solar wind varies in density, temperature and speed over time and over solar latitude and longitude

## thermodynamics

- is concerned with heat and temperature and their reaction to emerge and work  
	- the behaviour of these quantities is governed by the four laws of thermodynamics, irrespective of the composition or specific properties of the material or system in question

### [absolute zero](https://my.mindnode.com/XxH1FY7jU2FjbRbujTsHSdvCzC7mxpbP2osJqasC)

- is the lower limit of the thermodynamic temperature scale, a state at which the enthalpy and entropy of a cooled ideal gas reaches its minimum value, taken as 0  
- it is thought of as the lowest possible, but it is not the lowest enthalpy state possible  
- matter (solid) at absolute zero is in its group state, the point of lowest internal energy  
- by laws of thermodynamics, the absolute zero cannot be reached using only thermodynamic means, because the temperature of the substance been cooled approaches the temperature of the cooling agent asymptotically   
	- a system at absolute zero still possess quantum mechanical zero-point energy, the energy of its ground state at absolute zero  
	- the kinetic energy of the ground state cannot be removed

## [matter](https://my.mindnode.com/ZpWcFMjLGXAracsoyjHBzSxXPqbw8ox3yq4kKUqR)

- is any substance that has mass and takes up space  
	- this includes atoms and anything made up of these, but not other energy phenomena or waves such as light or sound  
- all everyday objects that we can bump into, touch or squeeze are ultimately composed of atoms  
	- this ordinary atomic matter is in turn made up of interacting subatomic particles - usually a nucleus of protons and neutrons, and a cloud of orbiting electrons  
- matter exists in states (or phases)

	- and fluid dynamics, the study of the effect of forces on fluid motion

## classical mechanics

- is concerned with the set of physical laws describing the motion of bodies under the influence of a system of forces  
- it describes the the motion of macroscopic objects, from projectiles to parts of machinery, as well as astronomical objects, such as spacecraft, planets, stars and galaxies  
- it provides extremely accurate results as long as the domain of study is restricted to large objects and the speeds involved do not approach the speed of light

### kinematics

- describes the motion of points (alternatively ‘particles’), bodies (objects) and systems of bodies without consideration of the masses of those objects nor the forces that may have caused the motion  
- often referred to as the ‘geometry of motion’

- continuum mechanics
  - deals with the analysis of kinematics and the mechanical behaviour of material modelled as a continuous mass rather than as discrete particles  
  - modelling an object as a continuum assumes that the substance of the object completely fills the space it occupies  
  	- modelling objects in this way ignores the fact that matter is made of atoms and so is not continuous   
  	- however on length scales much greater than that of inter-atom distances, such models are highly accurate  
  - it deals with physical properties of solids and fluids which are independent of any particular coordinate system in which they are observed
